Today we saw some [pretty crazy weather](http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/stormageddon-weather-pummels-nsw-dims-vivid-festival-floods-23-river-systems-20160604-gpbnzg.html) in Sydney (the image to the left is a photo from Japan from a couple of years ago, i just couldn't find a rainy photo i'd taken in sydney...).

So while cooped up inside I decided to mess around with a statically generated blog.

This is it.

Hard to say yet what's gonna go here, but probably food, travel, photography and product development related things.
